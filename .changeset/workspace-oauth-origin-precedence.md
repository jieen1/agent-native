Prefer the public auth origin (`APP_URL` / `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `WORKSPACE_OAUTH_ORIGIN`) over the workspace gateway URL when resolving Google OAuth redirect URIs, on both server and client. Filter out loopback gateway origins so dev workspaces don't accidentally redirect to localhost in production. The workspace dev runner forwards the resolved origin to per-app processes via `VITE_WORKSPACE_OAUTH_ORIGIN`.
